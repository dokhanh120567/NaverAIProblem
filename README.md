### e. Service Architecture & Database structure (when used)

**Client-Side Architecture:**
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: React-based SPA with client-side routing
- **Component Hierarchy**: 
  - App (Root component with state management)
  - Dashboard, Calendar, Analytics (Main view components)
  - TaskForm (Modal component for task creation/editing)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow with props and callbacks

**Data Storage Structure:**
- **LocalStorage Schema**:
  ```typescript
  // Tasks Storage
  {
    id: string,
    title: string,
    description: string,
    dueDate: string (ISO format),
    estimatedTime: number (minutes),
    actualTime?: number (minutes),
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
    category: 'assignment' | 'exam' | 'project' | 'personal' | 'work',
    status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed',
    createdAt: string (ISO format),
    completedAt?: string (ISO format),
    procrastinationScore?: number (0-100)
  }
  
  // Study Sessions Storage
  {
    id: string,
    taskId: string,
    startTime: string (ISO format),
    endTime?: string (ISO format),
    duration?: number (minutes),
    productivity: number (1-10 scale),
    notes?: string
  }
  ```

**Data Persistence Strategy:**
